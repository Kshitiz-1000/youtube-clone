## ## Core Features

This project isn't just a static design; it includes several dynamic features to mimic a real-world user experience:

* **🎨 Light & Dark Theme**: A theme toggle switch in the navbar allows users to switch between a light and dark mode. The user's preference is saved in their browser's local storage for a persistent experience.
* **📄 Dynamic Video Pages**: When a user clicks on a video from the homepage, the video page is dynamically populated with the correct title, channel name, and browser tab title using data passed through URL parameters.
* **▶️ Recommended Videos Sidebar**: The video page features a sidebar that automatically populates with a list of other videos, excluding the one currently being watched.
* **👍 Interactive Buttons**: Client-side like, dislike, and subscribe buttons that demonstrate UI interactivity.
* **💬 Commenting System**: A functional comment section on the video page where users can post new comments, which instantly appear in the comment list.
* ** LAYOUT Responsive Layouts**: The project uses modern CSS Grid and Flexbox to create responsive layouts for the video grid and page structure.
* **✨ Modern UI**: The navigation sidebar and overall design have been updated to match the current look and feel of YouTube.
